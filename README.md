# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
The goal of this project was to act as a Human Resources Analyst to determine who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions (and titles) will Pewlett Hackard need to fill. By doing this I helped future-proof PH by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package and a list of how many job titles are going to be open after that generation of employees retires.

Here is employee database relationship diagram for Pewlett Hackard:
